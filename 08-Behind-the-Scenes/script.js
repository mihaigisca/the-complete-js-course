// Lecture: An High-Level Overview of JavaScript
// The tip of the iceberg: JS is a high-level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language
// JS is a high-level, prototype-based object-oriented, multi-paradigm, interpreted or just-in-time compiled, dynamic, single-threaded, garbage-collected programming language with first class functions and a non-blocking event loop concurrency model

// high-level - developer does NOT have to worry about resources, everything happens automatically
// garbage-collected - cleaning old objects from the computer memory
// interpreted or just-in-time compiled language - abstraction over 0s and 1s (machine code) happens in JS Engine
// multi-paradigm - approaches and mindsets of structuring code, which will direct coding styles and techniques
// - procedural programming
// - object-oriented programming (OOP)
// - functional programming (FP)
// prototype-based object-oriented - everything are objects, expect primitive types
// first-class functions - functions are treated as regular variables
// dynamic - types become known at runtime and are automatically changed
// single-threaded - can only do one thing at a time
// - concurrency model: how JS engine handles multiple tasks happening at the same time
// non-blocking event loop - takes long-running tasks, executes them in "background", and puts them back in the main thread once they are finished
