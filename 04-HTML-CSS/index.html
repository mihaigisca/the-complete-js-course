<!-- Lecture: Basic HTML Structure and Elements -->
<!-- the starting file usually is named index.html -->
<!-- HTML code is wrapped into <html> tag -->
<!-- <head> tag contains webpage settings -->
<!-- <title> tag is the name of the browser tab -->
<!-- <body> tag contains the data to display -->
<!-- <h1>...<h6> tags are heading elements -->
<!-- <p> tag is the paragraph element -->
<!-- To insert the default initial HTML structure, from a new line type in ! and press tab -->

<!-- Lecture: Attributes, Classes and IDs -->
<!-- most of elements have open and closing tags <html>...</html> -->
<!-- some elements do not have closing tags <img ... />, <input ... /> -->
<!-- Nested elements are called child elements -->
<!-- Elements that directly contain other elements are called parent elements -->
<!-- Attributes are specific configurable settings of html elements -->
<!-- <a> tag is a link element, its content is the text to display, href attribute is the link to point to -->
<!-- Inline element - element that flows in line with rest of text (e.g., <a>) -->
<!-- Block elemet - element that starts from new line (e.g., <h1>) -->
<!-- id attribute is unique -->
<!-- class atribute is reusable -->
<!-- use <div> for generic boxes/containers -->
<!-- HTML convention is to use dashes between words -->
<!-- semantic - has meaning -->
<!-- <form> element is a semantic container as it is used when some data is typed in -->

<!-- Lecture: Basic Styling with CSS -->
<!-- elements can be styled directly in the element tag, in the <head> or in a separate .css file (recommended) -->
<!-- the .css file (usually named style.css) is linked to (referenced in) html file in <head> (<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" />) -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

    <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" />
